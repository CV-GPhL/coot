# TODO

* Allow nonsensical molecules (preferably with a toggle)
* Drawing functionality
  * Rework "appendix": draw _"NH2+"_ and so on
  * Bond Geometry
  * Different display options?
* Find a way to prevent molecules from flying around as they are being edited
  * Perhaps RDKit lowering should be split into two separate operations that are carried out when appropriate
    * Computing structure (atoms and bonds)
    * Managing coordinates
  * Maybe there's a way to preserve the spatial orientation of RDKit conformers
* Display SMILES
* Implement geometry tool
* File->New 
* Atom insert tool should 
  * _should it do anything for bonds? Insert an atom in between?_
  * Handle the 'X'/other element mode
* Rendering of exports
* How should "remove hydrogens" work?
* Implement charge tool
* Fetch
* What should the formatter do? Is it still needed?
* About dialog
