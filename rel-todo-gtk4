--- Widgets that have changed in GTK ---

Padding is gone, margins and layout are in.
Tables are out, Grids are in.
Radio buttons are gone, use check buttons instead.
HBoxes and VBoxes are gone, use generic Box
Toolbuttons, Toolcheckbutton, tooltogglebuttons are gone, use the non-tool version
Canvas is gone, use widget lists instead (how?)

----

Make a "framework" program for validation for Jakub - make a list of generic residue validation blocks.

Does the show_updating_maps_chooser() work? In refinement branch even?

Enable splash screen: 1
* I don't know how to make the window the right size! The image is display in 16 pixels width

Fix icon on startup: (coot-bin:15976): Gtk-WARNING **: 14:16:15.373: Could not load image 'pixmaps/coot-icon.png': Error opening file /usr/local/Cellar/cootgtk4/HEAD-b70d63f/share/coot/glade/pixmaps/coot-icon.png: No such file or directory ::: 0.5

"About Coot" is empty (was fixed in GTK3 version). Remake it in Cambalache?  ::: 0.5
* Nearly done - I need to be able to install the icon.

Enable the command line (e.g. --pdb and others) ::: 2

I think that one of the new buttons steals the focus from the graphics on startup now. ::: 0.5

How should the "model representation change" work? Ctrl Shift 2-finger scroll? ::: 1.0

Fix the Ctrl-drag function ::: 0.5

Fix the Map Parameters dialog widgets ::: 2

Fix "Edit Chi Angles" button ::: 1

New dialog for map masking ::: 1

Draw fixed atoms - anchors seems not to be working. Also, Angry Diegos are missing. Is this only on MacOS? ::: 1.0
* It works on the PC.

Restart the refinement on button-release when dragging an atom ::: 1

Key-binding for "clear all atom labels" ::: 0.25

coot_gui.smiles_gui() - is this a thing now? ::: 1

clean out coot_gui usage from coot_utils ::: 2
* Done, I think. Needs checking.

Fix "Rotamers" button ::: 1

Make a new Map masking dialog ::: 1

Get R/RC overlay dialog working  ::: 1

Get the "Map..." Button working. ::: 1

In the Display Manager, The "Delete Map" button doesn't delete the map row. ::: 1

Consider using double-click to do go to blob.  Where does "label atom" go then? Or how about middle-mouse on blob?
(pressing "G" on the keyboard is not intuitive). ::: 2

Do some more experimenting with validation graphs ::: 5

Full-fat render path - i.e. framebuffer need to be set up correctly (at the right time?) ::: 4

Can you make the rotamer dialog be an overlay? Not important.

Make the Fast-go-to-residue dialog be an overlay? No. A transient will do for now. ::: 0.5

Do the tutorial from time to time - what's missing? ::: 6

Find somewhere for auto-weight refinement coot_utils.auto_weight_for_refinement() ::: 1

Light Mode, Dark Mode, Automatic (tracks background colour) ::: 1

Find Somewhere for "Choose Undo Molecule" ::: 1

Find somewhere for coot.set_b_factor_bonds_scale_factor ::: 1

Dotted Surface ::: 1

HOLE ::: 2

Views ::: 1

RCrane - Make this a Module ::: 2

Find a home for New molecule by sphere ::: 1

Find a home for New molecule by symmetry op ::: 1

Make the Ligand Menu a module ::: 1

Low Priority: 3D Annotations ::: 3

Other Modelling tools should be in the menu ::: 2

rename residue, renumber waters, reorder chains, replace fragment, use SEGIDs in Edit menu ::: 0.2

Think of a way to start-up with certain modules on (in Preferences) ::: 2

In graphics_info_t::new_fill_combobox_with_coordinates_options() gtk_combo_box_set_active() doesn't work.
Why? Because it's looked up and not new? ::: 2

Fullscreen - maybe not possible in gtk4 ::: 0.2

Low Priority: think how to put the "Display Manager" into the main window ::: 6

Low Priority: history searching on python window up-arrow ::: 1

Low Priority: "Add hydrogens using Refmac" should not cause a lock up - give me a nice progress bar ::: 4

Low Priority: How can I make a flatpak for Coot?

Notes: GTK4 is needed for Vulkan and Vulkan is need for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution and Nvidia thing (name?)

"Accent Background" - 1: replace the blank background with a texture. 2: Make a texture using the current image
and blur it either using a framebuffer or by FFTing the image, truncating it and back transforming it (that
would allow the manipulation of the phases so that the background could morph (that might involve pre-generating
a number of textures and interpolating between them). Also consider a blurred textured blue background so that
it looks like the sea.  Or use texture background while Refmac is running.

---- "Do they need to work?" items -----

Map Skeletonization
User-defined menus in Python - connected via coot_main_menumodel.
Comboboxes with entries for old molecule, or duplicated entries.
