coot_gui.smiles_gui() - is this a thing now?
Not without --enhanced-ligand-gui it isn't
Note that biscu-it needs to be ported to Python 3.

--- Widgets that have changed in GTK ---

Padding is gone, margins and layout are in.
Tables are out, Grids are in.
Radio buttons are gone, use check buttons instead.
HBoxes and VBoxes are gone, use generic Box
Toolbuttons, Toolcheckbutton, tooltogglebuttons are gone, use the non-tool version
Canvas is gone, use widget lists instead (how?)

Have a look at adding thing this:
<style>
   <class name="suggested-action"/>
</style>
after a buttons's properties
Here are other styles:

    .image-button: used when the button contains only an image
    .text-button: used when the button contains only a label
    .flat: used for buttons with no border or background
    .keyboard-activating: used when the button is activated by keyboard input
    .suggested-action: used for buttons that are recommended or suggested actions
    .destructive-action: used for buttons that perform a destructive action, such as deleting data
    .circular: used for circular buttons

check the HUD NBC blocks in 89A - shouldn't lots of them be be labelled with "this residue" marker? ::: 1

Sun 23 Apr 21:33:42 BST 2023

   void HUDTextureMesh::setup_buffers() { ...
   // std::cout << "::::::::::: HUDTextureMesh::setup_buffers() " << name << " vao " << vao << std::endl;

   Turn this on and do a RSR, see that the Button Texture meshes have a new vao for each draw!  ::: 1

Fix "Edit Chi Angles" button ::: 1

Draw fixed atoms - anchors seems not to be working. Also, Angry Diegos are missing. Is this only on MacOS? ::: 1.0
* It works on the PC.

Pulling on atoms during refinement doesn't work with trackpad on macOS. ::: 2

Edit -> Residue Info: Fix up the dialog and toggle buttons ::: 1

Cell and Symmetry looks ugly - make it dynamic so the only button is "Close" ::: 1

Start up from Saved state. ::: 1

Enable the command line (e.g. --pdb and others) ::: 2

Making the window larger exposes more of the validation pane - even without validation graphs present ::: 1

Consider using double-click to do go to blob.  Where does "label atom" go then? Or how about middle-mouse on blob?
(pressing "G" on the keyboard is not intuitive). ::: 2

Double-click to recentre (G: go to blob) ::: 1

Full-fat render path - i.e. framebuffer need to be set up correctly (at the right time?) ::: 4

Curlew: ::: 4

rename draw-2.cc as tick-function.cc or some such

Get rid of "Other Modelling Tools" ::: 1

How do I add a single water? ::: 1

Make the Fast-go-to-residue dialog be an overlay? No. A transient will do for now. ::: 0.5

Map Skeletonization ::: 2

Enable splash screen: ::: 1
* I don't know how to make the window the right size! The image is display in 16 pixels width

Fix icon on startup: (coot-bin:15976): Gtk-WARNING **: 14:16:15.373: Could not load image 'pixmaps/coot-icon.png': Error opening file /usr/local/Cellar/cootgtk4/HEAD-b70d63f/share/coot/glade/pixmaps/coot-icon.png: No such file or directory ::: 0.5

"About Coot" is empty (was fixed in GTK3 version). Remake it in Cambalache?  ::: 0.5
* Nearly done - I need to be able to install the icon.

How should the "model representation change" work? Ctrl Shift 2-finger scroll? ::: 1.0

Do the tutorial from time to time - what's missing? ::: 6
Validation graphs colours

Find somewhere for auto-weight refinement coot_utils.auto_weight_for_refinement() ::: 1

Light Mode, Dark Mode, Automatic (tracks background colour) ::: 1

Find Somewhere for "Choose Undo Molecule" ::: 1

Find somewhere for coot.set_b_factor_bonds_scale_factor ::: 1

Key-binding/function to bump the B-factors up or down or match the neighbourhood.

Dotted Surface ::: 1

HOLE ::: 2

Views ::: 2

RCrane - Make this a Module ::: 2

Find a home for New molecule by sphere ::: 1

Find a home for New molecule by symmetry op ::: 1

Make the Ligand Menu a module ::: 1

Low Priority: 3D Annotations ::: 3

Other Modelling tools should be in the menu ::: 2

rename residue, renumber waters, reorder chains, replace fragment, use SEGIDs in Edit menu ::: 0.2

Think of a way to start-up with certain modules on (in Preferences) ::: 2

In graphics_info_t::new_fill_combobox_with_coordinates_options() gtk_combo_box_set_active() doesn't work.
Why? Because it's looked up and not new? ::: 2

Fullscreen - maybe not possible in gtk4 ::: 0.2

Low Priority: history searching on python window up-arrow ::: 1

Notes: GTK4 is needed for Vulkan and Vulkan is need for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution and Nvidia thing (name?)

Rework the namespace of the python modules to be more cannonical ::: 4

"Accent Background" - 1: replace the blank background with a texture. 2: Make a texture using the current image
and blur it either using a framebuffer or by FFTing the image, truncating it and back transforming it (that
would allow the manipulation of the phases so that the background could morph (that might involve pre-generating
a number of textures and interpolating between them). Also consider a blurred textured blue background so that
it looks like the sea.  Or use texture background while Refmac is running.

---- "Do they need to work?" items -----

User-defined menus in Python - connected via coot_main_menumodel.

Comboboxes with entries for old molecule, or duplicated entries.

CA Baton Mode

New Mesh algorithms:

Low Priority: think how to put the "Display Manager" into the main window :::- 6

Low Priority: "Add hydrogens using Refmac" should not cause a lock up - give me a nice progress bar :::- 4

Low Priority: How can I make a flatpak for Coot?
