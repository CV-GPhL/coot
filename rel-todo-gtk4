Boot Python
* Done!

Button icons

"Load tutorial model and data" should results in only one copy of the maps in the Display Manager.
(model is not duplicated)

Fix up the Display Manager - try isolating it and use Cambalache

"Reset View" seems to have focus. Make it be the graphics window.

Get PyGObject working with GTK4

Get Coot Python modules loading

Full-fat render path

Think how to put the "Display Manager" into the main window

Up and down in the python scripting window (do history searching on up-arrow)
