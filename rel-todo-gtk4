coot_gui.smiles_gui() - is this a thing now?
Not without --enhanced-ligand-gui it isn't
Note that biscu-it needs to be ported to Python 3.

--- Widgets that have changed in GTK ---

Padding is gone, margins and layout are in.
Tables are out, Grids are in.
Radio buttons are gone, use check buttons instead.
HBoxes and VBoxes are gone, use generic Box
Toolbuttons, Toolcheckbutton, tooltogglebuttons are gone, use the non-tool version
Canvas is gone, use widget lists instead (how?)

Have a look at adding thing this:
<style>
   <class name="suggested-action"/>
</style>
after a buttons's properties
Here are other styles:

    .image-button: used when the button contains only an image
    .text-button: used when the button contains only a label
    .flat: used for buttons with no border or background
    .keyboard-activating: used when the button is activated by keyboard input
    .suggested-action: used for buttons that are recommended or suggested actions
    .destructive-action: used for buttons that perform a destructive action, such as deleting data
    .circular: used for circular buttons

Download 7a0l (or anything) doesn't have (doensn't display) links when reading from an mmcif!
Check the links in all representation types ::: 4
OK, but this is a mmdb problem not a GTK4 Coot problem.
"Nice to have" - or change to scope to 10.

7a0l.cif doesn't load from the command line (related to 7a0l-assembly.cif non-load, I guess).
It's a molecule not a dictionary. The command_line::add() function needs to detect the difference.
All molecule .cif files fail to load on the command line? e.g. 7uv7
Now, should this be "nice to have" or "must have"?

7a0l colour by B-factor with fat bonds. Bonds to hydrogen atoms are grey and fat. ::: 5
Also, waters are too big. Also waters are too big in colour by molecule.
Bonds to hydrogen/deuteriums are too fat "Colour by Occupancy" and "Colour by B-factor all".
(also affects gtk3 coot - so think about fixing it there?).
Bonds to deuteriums in HOH are too fat in (default) "colour by atom" mode.
In PDB format, why are the links to the NA (around A 91?) half drawn in "Colour by Atom" mode?
H and or D all missing except A 127 in "Bonds Colour by Chain".
See "fat atom" commits.

Add highly-coordinated waters ::: 2

Check/Delete Waters needs testing ::: 1

* It works on the PC.

Pulling on atoms during refinement doesn't work with trackpad on macOS. ::: 2

Enable the command line (e.g. --pdb and others) ::: 2

Start up from Saved state. ::: 1
For now I can start by passing startup.py on the command line.

Making the window larger exposes more of the validation pane - even without validation graphs present ::: 1

Full-fat render path - i.e. framebuffer need to be set up correctly (at the right time?) ::: 4

Where is "Add Atom at Pointer"? Do I mean for waters and metals to be added using "Add  Other Solvent Molecules"? ::: 1

Curlew: ::: 4

rename draw-2.cc as tick-function.cc or some such

When adding a water "WARNING:: new atom addition blocked by nearby atom" needs a visual cue (red sonar)
on the atom that is blocking. ::: 1

Go into perspective project and with left-mouse pressed wave around the mouse wildly ::: 0.5

Fix icon on startup: (coot-bin:15976): Gtk-WARNING **: 14:16:15.373: Could not load image 'pixmaps/coot-icon.png': Error opening file /usr/local/Cellar/cootgtk4/HEAD-b70d63f/share/coot/glade/pixmaps/coot-icon.png: No such file or directory ::: 0.5

"About Coot" is empty (was fixed in GTK3 version). Remake it in Cambalache?  ::: 0.5
* Nearly done - I need to be able to install the icon.

How should the "model representation change" work? Ctrl Shift 2-finger scroll? ::: 1.0

Do the tutorial from time to time - what's missing? ::: 6
Validation graphs colours

Light Mode, Dark Mode, Automatic (tracks background colour) ::: 1

Other Modelling tools should be in the menu ::: 2

rename residue, renumber waters, reorder chains, replace fragment, use SEGIDs in Edit menu ::: 0.2

Think of a way to start-up with certain modules on (in Preferences) ::: 2

In graphics_info_t::new_fill_combobox_with_coordinates_options() gtk_combo_box_set_active() doesn't work.
Why? Because it's looked up and not new? ::: 2

Fullscreen - maybe not possible in gtk4 ::: 0.2

Low Priority: history searching on python window up-arrow ::: 1

Notes: GTK4 is needed for Vulkan and Vulkan is need for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution and Nvidia thing (name?)

Rework the namespace of the python modules to be more cannonical ::: 4

"Accent Background" - 1: replace the blank background with a texture. 2: Make a texture using the current image
and blur it either using a framebuffer or by FFTing the image, truncating it and back transforming it (that
would allow the manipulation of the phases so that the background could morph (that might involve pre-generating
a number of textures and interpolating between them). Also consider a blurred textured blue background so that
it looks like the sea.  Or use texture background while Refmac is running.



---- "Do they need to work?"/"Nice to have one day" items -----

7a0l-assemby.cif from rscb.org fails to import. Hmm! How to fix that!? Test case for gemmi-based import?

Caps lock key indicator?

Coot contact dots updated on model modification

How to represent a "Both" chirial (ambiguous) (are they the same thing?)

User-defined menus in Python - connected via coot_main_menumodel.

Comboboxes with entries for old molecule, or duplicated entries.

CA Baton Mode

New Mesh algorithms:
https://swiftcoder.wordpress.com/planets/isosurface-extraction/
https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/isosurface-extraction

Low Priority: think how to put the "Display Manager" into the main window :::- 6

Low Priority: "Add hydrogens using Refmac" should not cause a lock up - give me a nice progress bar :::- 4

Find somewhere for auto-weight refinement coot_utils.auto_weight_for_refinement()

Pointer distances:  It should be an overlay one day

Coot Info dialog:  It should be an overlay one day

Note: 7UMH is beasty that would look good rendered with colour-by-NCS-related chains (and vdw balls).

void HUDTextureMesh::setup_buffers() { ...
// std::cout << "::::::::::: HUDTextureMesh::setup_buffers() " << name << " vao " << vao << std::endl;
Turn this on and do a RSR, see that the Button Texture meshes have a new vao for each draw!  :::- 1
* It will do for now these are HUD text. One day rewrite, but not today.
